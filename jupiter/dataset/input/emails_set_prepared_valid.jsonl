{"prompt":"Subject: reply soon ! ! !\r\ndear sir ,\r\ni know this email will reach you as a surprise , but need not to worry as we are using the\r\nonly secured and confidential medium available to seekfor foreign assistance in a business .\r\nit is with heartfelt hope that i write to seek your co - operation and\r\nassistance in the context stated below : may i first introduce my self : i am\r\ndr . ( mrs . ) mariam abacha , the wife of late general sani abacha ( former\r\nmilitary head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria )\r\nwho died suddenly on 8 th june 1998 . i got your contact on the internet as\r\ni was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children ,\r\nhence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband .\r\ni have lost confidence with anybody within the country .\r\nhaving noted the confidence reposed on your person ,\r\ni became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving\r\nthe sum of us $ 20 million secretly willed in my favour by the late general\r\n( my husband ) .\r\nthis money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i have\r\nall documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault for\r\nsafe keeping . this money has been defaced for security reasons and also to\r\navoid it been spent by unauthorized persons .\r\nit is not an ill gotten wealth rather , it was generated from my\r\norganisation family support program ( f . s . p ) . i will enlighten you more of this\r\norganisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf .\r\non your acceptance to render this assistance to me\r\nto invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a\r\nconclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for\r\nnon - speculative investments in your country . however , the current civilian\r\nadministration of retired general olusegun obasanjo ( the president of the\r\nfederal republic of nigeria ) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family\r\nbecause of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late\r\nhusband while in office . in pursuit of this vendetta , the present government have\r\nresolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha including\r\nproperties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the\r\nvarious bank accounts of my husband in swizerland , uk , australia . in fact ,\r\nthe attack on our family ( the abacha ' s ) is so devastated to an extent of\r\nseizing our travelling passport , family accounts and even trying some members of our\r\nfamily in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband .\r\nin view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival , our\r\nfamily trustee have secretly protected the will , the security company has\r\ncalled me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the\r\ndemurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very\r\nsoon . but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas\r\namount , hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come\r\nto my full assistance and unlimited\r\nco - operation . in the meantime , there is a travelling embargo on us ( the whole\r\nfamily members ) and our local accounts are seized . we are currently living\r\non goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the\r\nsins\r\nof my late husband . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy\r\nand kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my\r\nchildren from a hopeless future . and if you agree to help , we will\r\ncompensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % of\r\nthe total amount of $ 20 million us dollars .\r\nin that case , when the money ( $ 20 million ) is moved into your\r\ndiscrete account , you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % in\r\nyour favour , while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur\r\n( there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed by\r\nyou . ) during the process of securing this consignment . the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for my\r\nchildren ' s future . my cousin ( dr . yemi musa ) has perfected arrangements with\r\nthe trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safe\r\noperation . what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance\r\ncompany where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fide\r\nowner . and in due course , all contacts must be made through\r\ndr yemi musa through this e - mail : address yemimusa 2 @ hotvoice . com and\r\nphone : 00221 512 48 59 . senegal .\r\ni look forward to your quick response while thanking\r\nyou for your co - operation . in view of all above\r\ndetails , i request you to keep this letter and\r\nco - operation highly confidential .\r\nbest wishes ,\r\nmrs . mariam abacha .\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Dear all,\nMy name is Dr Terry Norton..and I am the online employment co-\nordinator for Human resources employment team. This is a new\nemployment reform through Employment Agency License organization\nand the UNICEF ( The United Nations International Emergency\nFund) Created by the United nations general Assembly in 1946 to\nprovide food and health care to children in countries that had\nben devastated. Recently I was appointed as professor of\nMedicine.\nMost of UNICEF's work is in the field, with a presence in 190\ncountries and territories. UNICEF's network of over 150 country\noffices, headquarters and other offices, and 34 National\nCommittees carry out UNICEF's mission through programs developed\nwith host governments. Seven regional offices provide technical\nassistance to country offices as needed. Right now, The United\nNations has now created an online division through university\nHuman resources networks to employ a few students of its own and\nhelp around the communities.\nYou are reading this message because I need someone who can work\nas my Personal assistant while I am away and get paid THREE\nHUNDRED AND NINTY NINE DOLLARS\/wk. ($319-399) I am a member of\nMSF (Medicine Sans Frontiers) Doctors without Borders which\nrequires providing lifesaving medical humanitarian care to people\nall around the world. Emergencies like conflict and natural\ndisasters can inflict both visible and invisible wounds. People\nseek mental health care for many reasons-the loss of a family\nmember in an earthquake, the trauma of violence suffered or\nwitnessed, or the stress of forced displacement. MSF teams\nprovide mental health care and psychosocial support through both\nindividual and group sessions to help people cope with extremely\ndifficult situations.\nASSIGNMENT AND COMPENSATION:\nThis is a very simple employment. You will only help me Mail\nletters, Make payments at Walmart and purchase some Items when\nneeded also Manage, run personal & business errands\n* *Handle highly confidential and\/or sensitive matters with\ndiscretion and tact at all times\nThis employment only takes an hour a day and 3 times a week for\nTHREE HUNDRED AND NINTY NINE DOLLARS weekly. ($319-399)\nI am unable to meetup for an interview because I am currently\naway and helping the disabled students in Australia. You will be\npaid in advance for all tasks and purchased to be done on my\nbehalf and some of my personal letters and mails will be\nforwarded to your residence or nearby post office for you to pick\nup at your convenience. Upon my arrival we will discuss the\npossibility of making this a long-term employment if I am\nimpressed with your services while I am away. My arrival is\nscheduled for the last week of JUNE during the spring fall\nsemester 2020\nI got your email through a short list from the human resources\ndepartment to give out jobs to few students in your university.\nIf interested in this employment, Please send your Full name,\nAddress, Email, Alternate e-mail, Age and Mobile number to my\nofficial email: -\n@AOL.COM\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"Subject: california energy crisis\r\ncalifornia ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues .\r\nwhat happened in california\r\nthe source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .\r\nin addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .\r\nsecond , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .\r\nin short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices .\r\nat the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .\r\nenron ' s role\r\nmany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts :\r\n? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers .\r\n? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .\r\nyou may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a \" turnback \" of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts :\r\n? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates .\r\n? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices .\r\n? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times .\r\nenron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services .\r\nthe solution\r\nthe solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities .\r\nincreasing supply\r\ncalifornia ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities .\r\nreducing demand\r\ncustomers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .\r\nreducing reliance on the spot market\r\nin a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk .\r\nrestoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions\r\nthe utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed .\r\njust as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse .\r\nthe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .\r\nas you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 0"}
