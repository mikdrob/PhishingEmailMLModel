{"prompt":"Donation from Mrs. Josan Nowak\nMy dear beloved one, this is Mrs Josan Nowak I am from Estonia. I am married to Mr. Wilson Nowak, before he died in 2016. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief\nillness that lasted for only four days.\nBefore his death, both were born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my husband was alive he\ndeposited the sum of ($ 3.5 million) in the bank here in this country in a suspense account.\nCurrently, the fund is still in the bank. Recently, my doctor told me that I have serious sickness which is a cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Knowing my condition\ndecided to donate this fund to church or those who utilize this money the way I would recommend here. I want a church that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, to promote the word of\nGod and the effort that the house of God is maintained.\nThe Bible is for us to understand that blessed is the hand that gives. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband's relatives are not Christians\nand I do not want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid\nof death, so I know where I'm going. I know that I'm going to be in the bosom of man. Exodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I hold my peace.\nI do not need telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always and I do not want them to know about this\ndevelopment. In God all things are possible. As soon as I get an answer I will contact the bank here in Abidjan. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My\nhappiness is that I lived a life worthy Christian. Whoever wants to serve the lord must serve him in spirit and in truth. Always praying for their whole lives.\nReply me r more information, in your reply will give me room\nget an answer.\nsourcing another church or person\nthe same purpose. Let me assure you that they will act accordingly as specified. Hope to\nSend me the following information, as per below.\nYour full name ..........\nAddress.........\nAge .............\nPhone number .......\nThe occupation ........\nPhoto ...............\nAnd if i don't hear from you i will look for another person or any organization. May Almighty God bless you and use you to accomplish my wish. Pray for me always.\nSister Josan Nowak.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"Subject: personal contact\r\ndear sir \/ madam ,\r\nyou may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . the purpose of my mail is that i am mr . peter stevens , the second son of dr . dennis stevens , who was murdered some time ago in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i am writing from holland ( the netherlands ) where i am currently based as a political asylum seeker .\r\nbefore the death of my father , he took me to amsterdam in holland to deposit the sum of ( us $ 18 . 9 m ) eighteen million , nine hundred thousand united states dollars only , in a private security and finance company . may be he for - saw the looming danger in zimbabwe ? but this money was put in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and demurrage from the security company . this money was initially meant to purchase new machines and chemicals for the farms and also to establish a new farm in swaziland .\r\nthe land problem came when the government of zimbabwe under the leadership of president robert mugabe , introduced a new land use decree \/ act that , affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few blacks . this resulted to the mob action and killing by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society , so to say . infact , a lot of people were killed in this land reform act , including my father .\r\nit is against this back - ground , that i consulted with my family to transfer this money out of holland to a foreign account since i am now staying in holland and the law of netherlands , forbids a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to have such a money in an account . i am therefore saddled with the responsibility by my family to seek for a genuine person with foreign account to handle this transaction . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands because ; i will not like to go through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange does not allow such investment from asylum seekers .\r\ni must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , you will need to come to amsterdam the netherlands to open a non resident account which will aid us in the transfer of the money into any account you will provide . this money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative business of your choice .\r\ni have two options of offers for your assistance . you may go into partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon , or you may decide to have 20 % of the total sum , 70 % will be for me and my family and the remaining 10 % will be set aside for un - forseen expenses that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a successful end .\r\nyou may contact me on the above medias so that i know what your decision is , about this proposal . please note that your field of specialization is not a hindreance to this transaction .\r\nthank for your anticipated co - operations .\r\npeter stevens .\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 0"}
