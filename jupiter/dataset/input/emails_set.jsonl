Recently, my doctor told me that I have serious sickness which is a cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Knowing my condition\ndecided to donate this fund to church or those who utilize this money the way I would recommend here. I want a church that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, to promote the word of\nGod and the effort that the house of God is maintained.\nThe Bible is for us to understand that blessed is the hand that gives. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband's relatives are not Christians\nand I do not want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid\nof death, so I know where I'm going. I know that I'm going to be in the bosom of man. Exodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I hold my peace.\nI do not need telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always and I do not want them to know about this\ndevelopment. In God all things are possible. As soon as I get an answer I will contact the bank here in Abidjan. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My\nhappiness is that I lived a life worthy Christian. Whoever wants to serve the lord must serve him in spirit and in truth. Always praying for their whole lives.\nReply me r more information, in your reply will give me room\nget an answer.\nsourcing another church or person\nthe same purpose. Let me assure you that they will act accordingly as specified. Hope to\nSend me the following information, as per below.\nYour full name ..........\nAddress.........\nAge .............\nPhone number .......\nThe occupation ........\nPhoto ...............\nAnd if i don't hear from you i will look for another person or any organization. May Almighty God bless you and use you to accomplish my wish. Pray for me always.\nSister Josan Nowak.","completion":1}

changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure\r\npipeline allows this change . \"\r\nsome pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is\r\nfeedback - i assume for the same reasons\r\nwe had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems\r\n( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new\r\ndeal and we will have to zero out the old deal .\r\nbefore you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just\r\nin case it causes problems with their\r\npipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask\r\nthe unify team .\r\nthere is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im\r\nmarket east - but not from\r\nena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be\r\nthe same legal entity .\r\n\" warning - not the same legal entity \"\r\nalso - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals\r\n( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .\r\nonce the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items\r\nwere locked down for a reason .\r\nif you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down\r\ndata that was validated - and someone used these\r\ndeals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created\r\nusing these deals will get corrupted . always check\r\nwith someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in\r\nunify .\r\n- -

it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn ' t find a match . i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can ' t think of a valid reason for performing this work . i talked with dave nommensen , and according to him , what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place ? ? ? from a scheduling perspective , my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it . if you were overpathed , you ' d see it in the path manager either way . [ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up \/ downstream contract information and \/ or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path \/ activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .\r\n2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system \" autonoms \" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?\r\n3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .\r\n4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream \/ downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up \/ downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .\r\n5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .","completion":0}

( all intrastate pipelines that perform section 311 service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service . ) pg & e ' s filing proposed , in addition to the usual interruptible service , a firm section 311 service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service . pg & e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services .\r\n2 ) on february 25 , 2000 , southern union gas company , an intrastate transportation customer of pg & e , filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing . pg & e opposed the late intervention , but ferc granted it on april 14 , 2000 . ( pg & e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service . )\r\n3 ) southern union submitted data requests to pg & e on april 13 and april 17 . pg & e attempted to get a protective order issued , but ferc rejected their request .\r\n4 ) a settlement conference was held on september 7 , 2000 .\r\n5 ) a staff panel was convened on october 2 , 2000 , in order to conduct an advisory , non - evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues , with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within 90 days .\r\n6 ) on november 1 , 2000 , ferc requested 5 pages of additional information from pg & e in order to complete the application in the proceeding , which pg & e provided on november 8 th . on december 8 th , pg & e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request .\r\n7 ) on january 10 , 2001 , southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg & e .\r\n8 ) on january 17 , el paso field services informed ferc that pg & e texas pipeline , lp had been acquired by el paso on december 22 , 2000 , and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline , lp .\r\n9 ) on january 24 , 2001 , epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs .\r\n10 ) on july 17 , 2001 , epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below , where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no . 636 and 637 provisions to section 311 service providers . epgt stated that , if ferc proceeds with this policy , it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding . on july 30 , 2001 , southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt ' s supplemental comments .\r\n11 ) on august 3 , epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions , which provides for electronic nominations , two additional nomination cycles , bumping , clarified and updated credit provisions , modified quality provisions to protect system integrity , and more clearly defined authorized overrun service .\r\nthe ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section 311 service and requires that such service be provided on a non - discriminatory basis , but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require , for example , compliance with order nos . 636 and 637 .\r\nplease let me know if this is enough detail ( or maybe it ' s more than you wanted ! ! ) .","completion":0}

Recently I was appointed as professor of\nMedicine.\nMost of UNICEF's work is in the field, with a presence in 190\ncountries and territories. UNICEF's network of over 150 country\noffices, headquarters and other offices, and 34 National\nCommittees carry out UNICEF's mission through programs developed\nwith host governments. Seven regional offices provide technical\nassistance to country offices as needed.

People\nseek mental health care for many reasons-the loss of a family\nmember in an earthquake, the trauma of violence suffered or\nwitnessed, or the stress of forced displacement. MSF teams\nprovide mental health care and psychosocial support through both\nindividual and group sessions to help people cope with extremely\ndifficult situations.\nASSIGNMENT AND COMPENSATION:\nThis is a very simple employment. You will only help me Mail\nletters, Make payments at Walmart and purchase some Items when\nneeded also Manage, run personal & business errands\n* *Handle highly confidential and\/or sensitive matters with\ndiscretion and tact at all times\nThis employment only takes an hour a day and 3 times a week for\nTHREE HUNDRED AND NINTY NINE DOLLARS weekly.

{"prompt":"Subject: california energy crisis\r\ncalifornia ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues .\r\nwhat happened in california\r\nthe source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .\r\nin addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .\r\nsecond , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .\r\nin short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices .\r\nat the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .\r\nenron ' s role\r\nmany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts :\r\n? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers .\r\n? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .\r\nyou may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a \" turnback \" of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts :\r\n? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates .\r\n? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices .\r\n? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times .\r\nenron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services .\r\nthe solution\r\nthe solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities .\r\nincreasing supply\r\ncalifornia ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities .\r\nreducing demand\r\ncustomers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .\r\nreducing reliance on the spot market\r\nin a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk .\r\nrestoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions\r\nthe utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed .\r\njust as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse .\r\nthe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .\r\nas you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .","completion":0}

[ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up \/ downstream contract information and \/ or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path \/ activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .\r\n2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system \" autonoms \" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?\r\n3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .\r\n4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream \/ downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up \/ downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .\r\n5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time .

{"prompt":"Subject: please endeavour to use this for charity .\r\nfrom : mrs . ruth makary .\r\nplease endeavour to use this for charity .\r\ncalvary greetings ! !\r\nmy name is mrs . ruth makary a 65 yrs old lady . i am a cancer patient and a\r\nnationality of kuwait . i am married to mr . sammy makary who worked with\r\nkuwait embassy in switzerland for nine years before he died in an automobile\r\ncrash in december 1999 . we were married for eleven years without a child .\r\nbefore his death we were devoted christians . when my late husband was alive\r\nwe protected our assets of $ usd 5 million through the purchase of a life\r\ninsurance policy ( swiss variable annuities ) from a swiss life insurance\r\ncompany . i was irrevocably designates as beneficiaries of the policy . the\r\npurpose of this investment was to safe our principal capital and make use of\r\naccrues income from the annuities for our upkeep since the principal fund\r\nand the accrued interest are exempt from swiss taxes under swiss law . but\r\nunfortunately he dies .\r\nrecently , my doctor told me that i would not last long due to my cancer\r\nproblem . though what disturbs me most is my stroke . i developed this\r\nsickness as a result of the sudden shock and hearth attack i had when the\r\nbreaking news came to me on that faithful day that my husband was involved\r\nin an auto crash and died at the spot in the city of zurich in december\r\n1999 .\r\nhaving known my condition i decided to liquidate these assets and donate\r\nthis fund with all the accrued interests to church or better still a\r\nchristian individual that will utilize this money the way i am going to\r\ninstruct here in . i want an individual that will use this fund to churches ,\r\norphanages , research centers and widows , propagating the word of god and to\r\nensure that the house of god is maintained .\r\ni took this bold decision because i dont have any child that will inherit\r\nthis money and my husbands relatives are of questionable characters and are\r\nnot christians . and i dont want my hard earned money to be misused by\r\nunbelievers and i would dislike a situation where this money will be used in\r\nan ungodly manner . hence the reasons for taking this bold decision .\r\ni am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going and everyone is\r\nentitling to death . i know that i am going to be in the bosom of the lord .\r\nexodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my\r\npeace . i will be glad to speak with you if i had the privileged to do so .\r\nwith god all things are possible .\r\ni have briefed our attorney about this development . as soon as i receive\r\nyour reply indicating your interest to help me , i shall provide you with the\r\ncontacts of our lawyer in edinburgh , uk whom shall help you to process the\r\nfreezing of the life policy and have the fund transferred to you . to process\r\nthe liquidation of this asset would incur some expenses . please i urge you\r\nto take care of this as your contribution towards bringing this vision to a\r\nreality for the doing of god own thing . god loves a cheerful giver and i\r\npray that he gives you the wisdom to handle this project .\r\ni want you and the church to always pray for me . my happiness is that i\r\nlived a life of a worthy christian . whoever that wants to serve the lord\r\nmust serve him in spirit and truth . please always be prayerful all through\r\nyour life . any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for other\r\npeople for this same purpose .\r\nplease assure me that you will act accordingly as i stated here , and if in\r\nanyway you would not be interested , please discard this email and always\r\nremember me in your prayers . expecting to hearing from you .\r\nremain blessed in the name of the lord .\r\nyours in christ ,\r\nmrs . ruth makary .\r\n","completion":0}

setting up the new j . v .\r\nbetween enron & texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline\r\npipeline systems :\r\nsummary : the lrc & bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the\r\nname of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 %\r\nenron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading\r\non the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are in\r\nthe process of being drafted .\r\nenron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to\r\nsupport this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understand\r\nthat accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhaps\r\nscheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st\r\nfloor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen\r\ncenter once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jv\r\nwill start in early february for march production .\r\nto do ' s :\r\naccounting : i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it\r\ntransition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next\r\nmonday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same\r\npage and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks .\r\npc ' s : jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at my\r\nrequest . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs .\r\nnetworks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the\r\nvoice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spot\r\nis nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . a\r\ncombination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have been\r\nrequested .\r\nlocation on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson from\r\nfacilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv .\r\ncurrently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall\r\ncubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall\r\ncubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done .\r\ndata conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and\r\nmeter \/ facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin\r\ntrading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dump\r\nof this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need .\r\nwe also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also need\r\nto know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the\r\nsystem security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t know\r\nwho else will need access .\r\ninterface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scada\r\napplication : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright\r\nfrom texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two\r\napplications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface .\r\nthere will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' s\r\nrtu ' s \/ efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantime\r\nthere will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything\r\nis merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces between\r\npop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is\r\ncomplete .\r\nscada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s \/ efm communicate back to\r\nenron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back to\r\nthem via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costs\r\nby switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is best\r\ndone as a part of the scada transition .\r\naccounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to be\r\nbetter defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this\r\nprocess started .\r\nhourly volumes : bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be\r\nbilled on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talk\r\nthrough this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at least\r\ninitially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the\r\nbilling for this one customer .\r\nplease let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can have\r\nmy assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reached\r\nat 713 - 853 - 6858 . thanks ! - tommy","completion":0}

why do all the\r\ninternational lines except russia fly american\r\nplanes ? why does no other land on earth even\r\nconsider putting a man or woman on the moon ? you\r\ntalk about japanese technocracy , and you get radios .\r\nyou talk about german technocracy , and you get\r\nautomobiles . you talk about american technocracy ,\r\nand you find men on the moon - not once , but several\r\ntimes - and safely home again .\r\nyou talk about scandals , and the americans put\r\ntheirs right in the store window for everybody to\r\nlook at . even their draft - dodgers are not pursued\r\nand hounded . they are here on our streets , and most\r\nof them , unless they are breaking canadian laws , are\r\ngetting american dollars from ma and pa at home to\r\nspend here .\r\nwhen the railways of france , germany and india were\r\nbreaking down through age , it was the americans who\r\nrebuilt them . when the pennsylvania railroad and the\r\nnew york central went broke , nobody loaned them an\r\nold caboose . both are still broke .\r\ni can name you 5000 times when the americans raced\r\nto the help of other people in trouble . can you name\r\nme even one time when someone else raced to the\r\namericans in trouble ? i don ' t think there was\r\noutside help even during the san francisco\r\nearthquake .\r\nour neighbors have faced it alone , and i ' m one\r\ncanadian who is damned tired of hearing them get\r\nkicked around . they will come out of this thing\r\nwith their flag high . and when they do , they are\r\nentitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are\r\ngloating over their present troubles . i hope canada\r\nis not one of those . \"\r\nstand proud , america ! wear it proudly ! !\r\nthis is one of the best editorials that i have ever\r\nread regarding the united states . it is nice that\r\none man realizes it . i only wish that the rest of\r\nthe world would realize it . we are always blamed for\r\neverything , and never even get a thank you for the\r\nthings we do .\r\ni would hope that each of you would send this to as\r\nmany people as you can and emphasize that they\r\nshould send it to as many of their friends until\r\nthis letter is sent to every person on the web . i am\r\njust a single american that has read this , tribute to\r\nthe united states\r\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ?

( mrs . ) mariam abacha , the wife of late general sani abacha ( former\r\nmilitary head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria )\r\nwho died suddenly on 8 th june 1998 . i got your contact on the internet as\r\ni was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children ,\r\nhence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband .\r\ni have lost confidence with anybody within the country .\r\nhaving noted the confidence reposed on your person ,\r\ni became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving\r\nthe sum of us $ 20 million secretly willed in my favour by the late general\r\n( my husband ) .\r\nthis money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i have\r\nall documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault for\r\nsafe keeping . this money has been defaced for security reasons and also to\r\navoid it been spent by unauthorized persons .\r\nit is not an ill gotten wealth rather , it was generated from my\r\norganisation family support program ( f . s . p ) . i will enlighten you more of this\r\norganisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf .\r\non your acceptance to render this assistance to me\r\nto invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a\r\nconclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for\r\nnon - speculative investments in your country . however , the current civilian\r\nadministration of retired general olusegun obasanjo ( the president of the\r\nfederal republic of nigeria ) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family\r\nbecause of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late\r\nhusband while in office . in pursuit of this vendetta , the present government have\r\nresolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha including\r\nproperties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the\r\nvarious bank accounts of my husband in swizerland , uk , australia . in fact ,\r\nthe attack on our family ( the abacha ' s ) is so devastated to an extent of\r\nseizing our travelling passport , family accounts and even trying some members of our\r\nfamily in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband .\r\nin view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival , our\r\nfamily trustee have secretly protected the will , the security company has\r\ncalled me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the\r\ndemurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very\r\nsoon . but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas\r\namount , hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come\r\nto my full assistance and unlimited\r\nco - operation . in the meantime , there is a travelling embargo on us ( the whole\r\nfamily members ) and our local accounts are seized . we are currently living\r\non goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the\r\nsins\r\nof my late husband . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy\r\nand kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my\r\nchildren from a hopeless future . and if you agree to help , we will\r\ncompensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % of\r\nthe total amount of $ 20 million us dollars .\r\nin that case , when the money ( $ 20 million ) is moved into your\r\ndiscrete account , you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % in\r\nyour favour , while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur\r\n( there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed by\r\nyou . ) during the process of securing this consignment . the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for my\r\nchildren ' s future . my cousin ( dr . yemi musa ) has perfected arrangements with\r\nthe trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safe\r\noperation . what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance\r\ncompany where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fide\r\nowner . and in due course , all contacts must be made through\r\ndr yemi musa through this e - mail : address yemimusa 2 @ hotvoice . com and\r\nphone : 00221 512 48 59 . senegal .\r\ni look forward to your quick response while thanking\r\nyou for your co - operation . in view of all above\r\ndetails , i request you to keep this letter and\r\nco - operation highly confidential .\r\nbest wishes ,\r\nmrs . mariam abacha .\r\n","completion":0}
