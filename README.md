## Improving Phishing Classification Performance With OpenAI's GPT-3 API

This repository contains the implementation of different machine learning models for phishing email detection. The models are designed to classify emails as either phishing or legitimate. The models were implemented using Python, with scikit-learn, Keras, and OpenAI libraries.

### Run the [notebooks](https://github.com/mikdrob/PhishingEmailMLModel/tree/main/jupiter/notebook) in following order:

1. [data preparation](https://github.com/mikdrob/PhishingEmailMLModel/blob/main/jupiter/notebook/data_preparation.ipynb)
2. [create fine-tuned model](https://github.com/mikdrob/PhishingEmailMLModel/blob/main/jupiter/notebook/fine_tuning_create.ipynb)
3. [create embeddings](https://github.com/mikdrob/PhishingEmailMLModel/blob/main/jupiter/notebook/embeddings_create.ipynb)

**Upon completion of above steps you can run and test the rest of notebooks**
